<h1> Chicken Parmesian </h1>

<h2> Ingredients </h2>	
<p> as a huge fan of chicken and pasta one of my favorite recipes is the classic chicken parmesian. it being super easy to make is also a benefit to start grab the following ingredients: </p>
<!-- list of ingredients -->
<ul>
<li> chicken breast (bone removed) </li>
<li> eggs </li>
<li> flour </li>
<li> bread crumbs (although any will work Panko (Japanese bread crumbs, used in tempura) are the best in my opinion) </li>
<li> pasta sauce (or a can of crushed tomatoes will work in a pinch </li>
<li> parmesian cheese </li>
<li> parsley to garnish </li>

</ul>
<p> This will make up 100% of the chicken part of it, the recipe is better with pasta sauce then a can of crushed tomatoes but there is so much good stuff that if you just use crushed tomatoes you can't really go wrong. </p>

<!-- list of steps to make the food -->
<ol> 
<li> break the eggs into a bowl and scramble them add a little water to thin it out and you have some eggwash, </li> 
<li> pour the flour and the bread crumbs into seperate bowls </li>
<li> Take the chicken and coat it in flour </li>
<li> when its fully coated in flour, coat it in your egg wash </li>
<li> take it out of the eggwash, shake off any excess and coat it in the bread crumbs, and press to make sure they stick. Place it on a seperate cooking tray </li>
<li> repeat for the rest of the chicken </li>
<li> cook in the oven at 350 degrees farenheit, turning regularly because the ones closer to the edge will cook faster. When they all reach internal temperature of 160 or higher they are done </li>

<p> When you get to that point its pretty much done, when you are about to serve it, heat up the pasta sauce and put it on the chicken and put the parmesian cheese on it after that, put in the oven to broil until the cheese is melted and its all done </p>
<p> if it looks like the picture on the right you are good to go </p>
